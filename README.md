CO2 monitor with Z-wave fan control for Raspberry Pi

This is a WORK IN PROGRESS, and not ready for use.

My goal is to connect a CO2 sensor and Z-wave controller to a Raspberry Pi, and run the bathroom exhaust fan whenever CO2 levels are high. The device should operate with a read-only filesystem and no internet access.

### Hardware I'm using
- Raspberry Pi 3 B+
- CanaKit Premium Black Case hot glued to a MicroUSB power supply
- HUSBZ-1 USB Z-wave controller or Z-Wave.Me RaZberry2
- Adafruit SCD-30 CO2 sensor
- UltraPro Z-Wave Plus toggle switch
