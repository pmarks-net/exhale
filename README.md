CO2 monitor with Z-wave fan control for Raspberry Pi

This is a WORK IN PROGRESS, and not ready for use.

My goal is to connect a CO2 sensor and Z-wave controller to a Raspberry Pi, and run the bathroom exhaust fan whenever CO2 levels are high. The device should operate with a read-only filesystem and no internet access.

### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi
- HUSBZ-1 USB Z-wave controller
- Adafruit SCD-30 CO2 sensor
- UltraPro Z-Wave Plus toggle switch
- Some sort of enclosure with vent holes (TBD)
